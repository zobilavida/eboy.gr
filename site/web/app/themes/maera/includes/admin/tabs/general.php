	<h1 class="maera-general-title">Welcome to the Maera Theme</h1>
	<hr>
	<p class="big">Maera is one of the most versatile and modular WordPress Theme Frameworks, allowing both developers and novice users to build amazing sites and take advantage of its unique features.</p>
	<div style="height: 1em;"></div>
	<p>Maera introduces the concept of <strong>shells</strong>, essentially child themes built as plugins that can change and affect every aspect of your theme and presentation, allowing you to build a completely customized experience for your site and your users.</p>

		<h2>Modular in nature</h2>
		<p>The core of the theme is a set of libraries that allows you to extend it and use it however you like! Using <strong>Shells</strong> and plugins you can add or remove features and customize your site using just the bits and pieces that you need.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="columns3 second">
		<span class="title-icon dashicons dashicons-admin-plugins"></span>
		<h2>Plugins</h2>
		<p>Instead of bundling extra libraries in the plugin, we are requiring you to install some 3rd-party plugins. This way you can get updates for them without the need to update the core of your theme, while at the same time makes it easier for developers to tackle issues when the need arises.</p>

		<h2>Uses <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html">Twig</a></h2>
		<p>Twig is an amazing templating engine that uses a simple syntax, allowing non-php developers to understand and tweak their own templates, further customizing their own site. You can find these templates in the <code>/views</code> folder in your theme.</p>
